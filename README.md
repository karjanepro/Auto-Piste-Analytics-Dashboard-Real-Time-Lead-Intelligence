## System Architecture
The system employs a distributed architecture to enhance security and scalability. The data infrastructure includes:

SSH Connection to Cloud Database: The application securely connects to a cloud-based SQL database using SSH, ensuring encrypted communication between the system and the database server.

Data Collection from External Cloud Database: APIs are used to collect real-time data from a separate cloud-based database hosted on OVH, enabling the dashboard to display live lead intelligence metrics and campaign performance data.

Distributed System for Security: The system is designed with multiple layers and distributed components to prevent single points of failure, increase data redundancy, and enhance security levels.
